Harvester is a lightweight, vanilla-friendly plugin that enhances crop farming in Minecraft. With a single right-click, players can harvest fully grown crops and automatically replant them using one seed, saving time and keeping the vanilla experience intact. Supporting wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, and nether wart, Harvester is ideal for survival servers looking to streamline farming without complex mechanics.
